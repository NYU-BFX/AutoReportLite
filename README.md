## AutoReportLite
Automatic analysis pipline &amp; reporting template, using bash, R, and LaTeX. 

#### Step 1. 
Create sample sheet to describe samples for analysis and other relevant information per sample (sample-sheet.tsv)

#### Step 2.
Setup analysis pipeline script using items from sample sheet (code/analysis_pipeline.sh)

#### Step 3.
Parse the sample sheet to create subdirectories per sample and pass items to the script for analysis (workflow.Rmd)

#### Step 4.
Adjust report file to set project information, file paths, figures, as needed for inclusion in the report (report/auto-report.Rnw). Compile the report with knitr in R (.Rnw -> .tex) and pdflatex in the terminal (.tex -> .pdf)


#### TIPS:
- Use the workflow.Rmd to set up your pipeline's directory structure
- Create a parent directory for the pipeline output, with a subdirectory for each sample to be processed; the name of the subdirectory should correspond to the name or ID for the sample
- Set up your pipeline script to work on one sample, and output all of that sample's results in its corresponding pipeline subdir
- If not using `qsub` for script submission then pipe the stdout and stderr from the pipeline script to log files
- If not using `qsub` then run the pipeline script in a `for` loop from the workflow.Rmd
